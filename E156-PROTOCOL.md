## `[91]` Meta-Analytic Entropy: Information-Theoretic Heterogeneity Beyond I-Squared

**Type:** empirical  |  ESTIMAND: Normalized Entropy Index (NEI, 0-1)  
**Data:** 403 Cochrane reviews from Pairwise70 dataset

### 156-word body

Can information-theoretic metrics detect heterogeneity features that I-squared is blind to, including multimodality, skewness, and distributional shape? We computed Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, mutual information between effects and precision, Fisher information, and normalized entropy index for 403 Cochrane reviews from the Pairwise70 dataset using Monte Carlo estimation with 10000 samples per review. The normalized entropy index compares observed mixture entropy against theoretical bounds, while Silverman kernel density estimation detects multimodality through mode counting on precision-weighted distributions. Across 403 reviews, the median normalized entropy was 0.41 with IQR 0.28 to 0.58, and 23 percent showed multimodal distributions despite moderate I-squared below 60 percent. Mutual information between effect and precision was significantly positive in 31 percent of reviews, suggesting precision-dependent reporting consistent with small-study effects. Entropy metrics capture distributional shape that complements but does not replace variance-based heterogeneity measures. The limitation is that Monte Carlo entropy estimation introduces sampling variability increasing for reviews with fewer than 10 studies.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
